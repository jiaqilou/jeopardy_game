.sql file is included in the folder.
console may print out weird things, just ignore it...
before you run the program, you need to increase the heap space for Eclipse, otherwise it may cause outofmemoryerror if there are 3 or 4 players, 
click the Run -> Run Configurations -> Choose the main of my program -> click argument->in VM arguments add "-Xms512M"
this will increse heap space of eclipse to 512M.
Thank you so much!
